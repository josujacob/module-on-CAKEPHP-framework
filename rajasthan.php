                           <h4>  <strong><i><u> RAJASTHAN : THE CITY OF FORTS ... </u></i></strong></h4><br>
                           <strong> <p>Rajasthan is one of the most popular tourist destinations in India, for both domestic and international tourists. Rajasthan attracts tourists for its historical forts, palaces, art and culture. Every third foreign tourist visiting India also travels to Rajasthan as it is part of the Golden Triangle for tourists visiting India.[1][2][3]

Endowed with natural beauty and a great history, Rajasthan has a flourishing tourism industry. The palaces of Jaipur, lakes of Udaipur, and desert forts of Jodhpur, Bikaner and Jaisalmer are among the most preferred destinations of many tourists, Indian and foreign. Tourism accounts for eight percent of the state's domestic product. Many old and neglected palaces and forts have been converted into heritage hotels. Tourism has increased employment in the hospitality sector. The main sweet of this place is ghewar.</p> </strong><br>
                        <h4>  <strong><i><u> PLACES TO VISIT :</u></i></strong></h4><br>
                 <ul>
                 <li><strong><u><h5>AMBER FORT</h5></u></strong>
                       <strong> <p>Amber Fort is located in Amer (a town with an area of 4 square kilometres (1.5 sq mi)), 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) from Jaipur, Rajasthan state, India. It is one of the principal tourist attractions in the Jaipur area, located high on a hill. Anber Fort Was Built By  Raja Man Singh I. Amber Fort is known for its artistic style, blending both Hindu and Rajput elements. With its large ramparts, series of gates and cobbled paths, the fort overlooks the Maota Lake, at its forefront.

The Amber Fort was built by ‘Raja Shri Maan Singh JI Saheb’ (Maan Singh I) (December 21, 1550 – July 6, 1614) in 16th century. Man Singh, one of the first war chiefs or the trusted general of the Emperor Akbar. Akbar included him among the ‘Navaratnas’, or the 9 (nava) gems (ratna) of the royal court. Man Singh began the construction of a fortress-palace of white and red sandstone i.e. Amber Fort in 1592. He was the Kacchwaha (Rajput) of King of Amber, a state later known as Jaipur. Nearby he ordered to set a small temple devoted to ‘Sheela Mata’, his patron goddess </p> </strong><br>

                   <li><strong><u><h5>JAISALMER: WHERE THE FORTS ARE STILL ALIVE</h5></u></strong>
                       <strong> <p>If geology interests you, then Jaisalmer is where you need to journey. The Wood Fossil Park or Aakal is located about 15 kilometres away from the city. Here, one can discover and trace geologic tragedies that occurred in the Thar Desert 180 million years ago. The city of Jaisalmer also acts as the guard to western Rajasthan (and India’s) frontier. This 'Golden City’ is located close to the Pakistan border and in close proximity to the Thar Desert. The city’s most prominent landmark is the Jaisalmer Fort, also called Sonar Qila (Golden Fort). Unlike most other forts in India, Jaisalmer Fort is not just a tourist attraction. It houses shops, hotels and ancient havelis (homes) where generations continue to live.

Jaisalmer traces its inception to the 12th century. History tells us of Rawal Jaisal, the eldest heir of the Rawal of Deoraj, was passed over for the throne of Lodurva and a younger half-brother was crowned king. Rawal Jaisal went looking for a new location to set up his capital when he came across sage Eesul. The sage told him about Krishna’s prophecy which said that a descendant of his Yaduvanshi clan would found a new kingdom at this same spot. It was in 1156 that Rawal Jaisal constructed a mud fort, named it Jaisalmer after himself and declared it his capital.</p> </strong><br>

                   <li><strong><u><h5>JODHPUR: A DELIGHTFUL BLEND OF THE MODERN AND THE TRADITIONALS</h5></u></strong>
                       <strong> <p>Jodhpur, the second largest city in Rajasthan is popularly known as the Blue City. The name is clearly befitting as most of the architecture – forts, palaces, temples, havelis and even houses are built in vivid shades of blue. The strapping forts that tower this magnificent city sum up to a spectacle you would not want to miss. The mammoth, imposing fortress of Mehrangarh has a landscape dominating a rocky ridge with the eight gates leading out of the fortress. The new city is located outside the structure. Jodhpur is also known for the rare breed of horses known as Marwari or Malani, which are only found here. 

Jodhpur marks its origin back to the year of 1459 AD. The history of this prosperous city revolves around the Rathore clan. Rao Jodha, the chief of Rathore Clan is credited with the origin of Jodhpur in India. The city is known to be built in place of the ancient capital, Mandore of the state of Manwar. Hence, the people of Jodhpur and surrounding areas are commonly known as Marwaris. Also, it is believed that the relics of Mandore can still be witnessed in the Mandore Gardens.

                   <li><strong><u><h5>JAL MAHAL: THE WATER PALACE</h5></u></strong>
                       <strong> <p> Possibly the most serene sight amidst the chaos of Jaipur is the beautiful Jal Mahal Jaipur, the Water Palace. This low-rise symmetrical palace, that once was a shooting lodge for the Maharajah, appears to float in the centre of Sagar Lake. The light sand coloured stone walls of the Jal Mahal Jaipur are at a stark contrast to the deep blue of the waters of the lake, while from the innards of the palace lush foliage sprouts.
This majestic scene makes the Jal Mahal Jaipur’s most photographed (and photograph friendly) monument but unfortunately exploration of the actual palace is off limits to the majority of visitors as it is to be transformed into an ultra exclusive restaurant.

                   <li><strong><u><h5>SAM SAND DUNES</h5></u></strong>
                       <strong> <p>Sam Sand Dunes is a must visit in the state of Rajasthan in the environs of the city of Jaisalmer. It is likely that you are going for a Desert Safari when planning to visit Thar Desert or else, the point of going there is useless, making the Sam Sand Dunes an increasing major tourist attraction of the city.

Although it is said many times that Jaisalmer is the best time of the day to go there is before sunsets at around 4-6 PM or in the wee hours of the morning at 4-6 AM, before the sun rises. Most of the visitors are in jeep loads coming from Jaisalmer who are being chased by stubborn camel owners for a ride with fees, children dancing on the street dressed up in a local outfit, and little children and even young guys who sell soft drinks to quench the thirst.

The place has become very touristy over the years; many want to experience the desert during sunsets and sunrise, which is some sort of being in a carnival atmosphere than any other. But there are still some glorious piece in this part of the world that have not yet been touched by so many travelers which are still yet to be revealed to the rest of the world. Sam Sand Dunes will always be an important journey to experience Jaisalmer and Rajasthan as a whole.  </p> </strong><br>

                    <li><strong><u><h5>GADISAR LAKE</h5></u></strong>
                       <strong> <p>Gadsisar Lake is one of the major tourist attractions of Jaisalmer. Just leave the madding crowd behind and venture towards the outskirts and you will find yourself next to the famous Gadsisar Lake. Contrary to the popular belief, it is not an oasis but a water conservation tank made around 1400 A.D. by the then maharaja of Jaisalmer, Maharwal Gadsi Singh. Can you believe this structure just outside the city walls once acted as a reservoir that controlled the entire supply of water to the arid city! 

This place was selected because it had a certain amount of declivity already and it automatically retained some of the rainwater. If you are lucky and venture out in winters, you might get to see a variety of migratory birds. Due to its proximity to Bharatpur, some of the birds get attracted to this place also. Don't miss to carry a good pair of binoculars and SLR camera with a wide-angle lens if you want to take away some really mesmerizing snaps. 

You will find whole varieties of temples and shrines surrounding the lake. In later years it became more of a pilgrimage spot. The beautiful gateway that arches across the road down to the Lake was built by royal courtesan named Tillon in the end of 19th century, known as Tillon Ki prol (Gate of Tillon). Lord Vishnu's statue was installed in the year 1908 A.D. or the gate by the courtesan & declared Krishna Temple to save it from demolition by the then Maharawal  </p> </strong><br>
